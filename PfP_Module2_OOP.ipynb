    "Most of this was review. A couple new takeaways:\n",
    "* Class atributes vs instance atributes: class atributes (defined above the `__init__`) are **shared by all instances of the class**. Note that this means that **updating it for one instance will update it for all instances!**\n",
    "* Python class attributes and methods are public by default. Attributes or methods can be made private (unaccesible) by using two underscores (i.e., `self.__name = 'private name'`). \n",
    "* Trying to access a private attribute will throw an error, however, we can use use the following syntax to access if necessary:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class TestClass:\n",
    "    def __init__():\n",
    "        self.__private_name = 'private name'\n",
    "\n",
    "class_instance = TestClass()\n",
    "class_instance.__private_name -> AttributeError!\n",
    "\n",
    "class_instance._TestClass__private_name -> 'private name'\n",

    "# Information Hiding\n",
    "* Information hiding refers to hiding aspects of a class, and providing an outward facing interface. This is relevant because of the fact that class attributes/methods are shared by all instances of a class, therefore you do not want to allow an instance to effect other instances via altering such attributes/methods.\n",
    "* **Encapsulation**: The idea that data and any methods used to alter said data should be bound together in a single class. This can be done by making private attributes, and creating a public interface (i.e. getters and setters) to interact with them. For example, a login class where the username and password were public attributes would allow anyone to set the password for a user to whatever they want, and easily hack into the system!\n",
    "* Simple getter and setter example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class User:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, username=None):  # defining initializer\n",
    "        self.__username = username\n",
    "\n",
    "    def setUsername(self, x): # setter\n",
    "        self.__username = x\n",
    "\n",
    "    def getUsername(self): # getter\n",
    "        return (self.__username)\n",
    "```\n",
    "* **Note that class functions can alter private attributes/methods, but direct setting on a instance is not allowed!** This also allows the nature of changes to a class to be highly regulated.\n",
    "* Also note that private attributes can be instantiated in the `__init__` function.\n",
    "* **See below for interesting nuance around private attributed!**"

    "# Object Relationships\n",
    "* As opposed to inheritence, where classes have relationships, there are other situations wher you want objects to have relationships.\n",
    "* A class can be another class, can be a part of another class, or a class can have a another class's object as a property. The later two are refered to as \"association\".\n",
    "* **Aggregation**: A class can have a **reference to another class** as an attribute. If one deletes the main class, the referenced-to continues to exist. Not that crazy in practice, for example, one can instantiate a class with an object as the argument. The object lives on even when the class is deleted.\n",
    "* **Composition:** Refers to a \"part-of\" relationship where a class objects are instantialized as part of the `__init__` of another class. When the class is deleted, the objects composing the class are too.\n",
    "* In the final problem, when I instantiated a attribute from the init arguments (default argument), it failed, but worked when it wasn't an argument! Be careful here!"
